    "## 1. Header Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Header files, or `.h` files, allow related function, method, and class declarations to be collected in one place. The corresponding definitions can then be placed in `.cpp` files. **The compiler considers a header declaration a \"promise\" that the definition will be found later in the code,** so if the compiler reaches a function that hasn't been defined yet, it can continue on compiling until the definition is found. This allows functions to be defined (and declared) in arbitrary order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, there is a preprocessor directive:\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#ifndef HEADER_EXAMPLE_H\n",
    "#define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H\n",
    "```\n",
    "at the top of the header, along with an `#endif` at the end. This is called an \"include guard\". Since the header will be included into another file, and `#include` just pastes contents into a file, the include guard prevents the same file from being pasted multiple times into another file. This might happen if multiple files include the same header, and then are all included into the same main.cpp, for example. The `ifndef` checks if `HEADER_EXAMPLE_H` has not been defined in the file already. If it has not been defined yet, then it is defined with `#define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H`, and the rest of the header is used. If `HEADER_EXAMPLE_H` has already been defined, then the preprocessor does not enter the `ifndef` block. Note: There are other ways to do this. Another common way is to use an `#pragma once` preprocessor directive, but we won't cover that in detail here. See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard) for examples."

    "## 2. Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The overloading of the ampersand symbol `&` and the `*` symbol probably contribute to much of the confusion around pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The symbols `&` and `*` have a different meaning, depending on which side of an equation they appear.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely important to remember. For the `&` symbol, if it appears on the left side of an equation (e.g. when declaring a variable), it means that the variable is declared as a reference. If the `&` appears on the right side of an equation, or before a previously defined variable, it is used to return a memory address, as in the example above."

    "## 3. References vs Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "* References must be initialized when they are declared. This means that a reference will always point to data that was intentionally assigned to it.\n",
    "* References can not be null. This means that a reference should point to meaningful data in the program.\n",
    "* When used in a function for pass-by-reference, the reference can be used just as a variable of the same type would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointers\n",
    "* Pointers can be declared without being initialized, which is dangerous. If this happens mistakenly, the pointer could be pointing to an arbitrary address in memory, and the data associated with that address could be meaningless, leading to undefined behavior and difficult-to-resolve bugs.\n",
    "* Pointers can be null. In fact, if a pointer is not initialized immediately, it is often best practice to initialize to `nullptr`, a special type which indicates that the pointer is null.\n",
    "* When used in a function for pass-by-reference, a pointer must be dereferenced in order to access the underlying object.\n",
    "\n",
    "References are generally easier and safer than pointers. As a decent rule of thumb, references should be used in place of pointers when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are times when it is not possible to use references. One example is object initialization. You might like one object to store a reference to another object. However, if the other object is not yet available when the first object is created, then the first object will need to use a pointer, not a reference, since a reference cannot be null. The reference could only be initialized once the other object is created."

    "In the cell below, we have created a hash table (`unordered_map`) to store the data from the example above. To create an `unordered_map` in C++, you must include the `<unordered_map>` header, and the sytnax for declaring an `unordered_map` is as follows:\n",

    "In the code below, we check if the key is in the `unordered_map` using the `.find()` method. If the key does not exist in the map, then `.find()` returns an `unordered_map::end()` type.
